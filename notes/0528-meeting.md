Meeting 05/28

- orthogonal fofo
- matching section in front end
- hfofo can cool both m and mbar 
- change field strengths etc in yui's matching channel to have the final momentum at caroline's design input
- `sol_place7_31.txt` --> just 7 coils make up the matching section
    - starting at RotSol at z=-3000
- go over twiss parameters
- transfer matrix
- angular momentum induced in beam due to edge effects in solenoid
    - phase space rotates
    - this rotation can be used as part of matching
    - angular momentum can be used to separate charges
- don't rely too much on input files, use visualizations as sanity checks
- use `trace` to check the magnetic fields and the tuples at locations instead of placing detectors to avoid interactions with the 
- last meeting: fernow's paper
- ~join github, slack~
- estimating twiss parameters -> from phase space evolution, get covariance matrix, 
- pi resonance -> sudden loss in phase space
- mechanical orbital momentum (xpy - ypx) 
- what about canonical orbital momentum ?
- Br couples to pz creating orbital momentum
- from maxwell equation, from Bz as a fucntion of z, we can derive / estimate B_r from Masxwell's equation for free  (crul B = 0, div B = 0)
- make Bz vs z plot from solenoid, we can get \partial Bz / \partial z by looking at the slopes on the plots instead of estimating the function. 

To-do:

- [x] ~Join Slack~
- [ ] Find GitHub
- [ ] Look at Fernow's paper
- [ ]
