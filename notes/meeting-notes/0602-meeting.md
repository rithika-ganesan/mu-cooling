 - look at relation between dispersion
 - also look at x and y individually when a tilt is added
 - for a second coil, flip polatity to see if you can cancel out angular momentum
 - see if dispersion exists even when angular momentum is cancelled out
 - ideally dispersion and angular momentum should be decoupled
 - look at pz from B_r -> lorentz force along z
 - dp_r / dt = dp_r / dz times dz / dt = v_z tmes
