- change both parameters to see periodicity for B and p and see if L changes as predicted by analytical model
- changing the amplitude(?) which depends on L --> so change px, py to see if there are meaningful changes
- focussing changes greatly depending on B, p values even for a single solenoid
- thin lens analysis depends on linearity -> mathieu equations instead
- validate analytical model:
    - perhaps using the above methods, might not work
    - paper for solving equations numerically/analytically
- for a single coil you can check the phase rotation?
- stopband models?
- when things are designed from scratch they start with a hamiltonian? 
- intermediate between continuum helical channel and more discretized rectilinear channel

notes 
---

- start with a single coil and look at the angular momentum and see how different tilts etc. change it. 
- maybe describe the rest?
